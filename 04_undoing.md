## 4. Undoing Changes and Fixes

Sometimes, mistakes happen. Git provides multiple ways to undo changes at various stages of your workflow. This section covers three primary methods: reverting commits, resetting commits, and restoring changes in your working directory.

---

### Reverting a Commit

**Command:**
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```
**What it does:** Creates a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by the specified commit. This method preserves the commit history and is safe for shared branches.

**Example:**
```bash
git log --oneline
# Suppose the commit you want to revert is ab12cd3
git revert ab12cd3
```
This creates a new commit that reverses the changes from `ab12cd3`.

**Exercise:**
1. Identify a recent commit using `git log --oneline`.
2. Revert that commit using `git revert <commit-hash>`.
3. Run `git log --oneline` to see the new revert commit in your history.

### Resetting Commits

`git reset` moves the branch pointer to a previous commit and can modify your staging area and working directory based on the chosen option.

#### Soft Reset

**Command:**
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```
**What it does:** Moves the HEAD pointer back one commit but leaves your changes staged.

**Example:**
```bash
git commit -m "Temporary commit"
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```
After this, your changes remain staged, allowing you to recommit them if needed.

#### Mixed Reset (Default)

**Command:**
```bash
git reset HEAD~1
```
or
```bash
git reset --mixed HEAD~1
```
**What it does:** Moves the HEAD pointer back one commit and unstages the changes, but leaves the modifications in your working directory.

#### Hard Reset

**Command:**
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```
**What it does:** Moves the HEAD pointer back one commit and discards all changes in the staging area and working directory. **Warning:** This command will permanently delete uncommitted changes.

**Exercise:**
1. Make a commit (e.g., `git commit -m "Test commit"`).
2. Use `git reset --soft HEAD~1` and check the status to see your changes still staged.
3. Repeat with `--mixed` and observe that changes are unstaged but remain in the working directory.
4. **(Optional and careful!)** Try `--hard` in a test branch to see how it discards changes.

### Restoring Changes in the Working Directory

Sometimes you only want to undo changes in your working directory without altering commit history.

#### Using git restore

**Command for unstaged changes:**
```bash
git restore <file>
```
**What it does:** Reverts the changes in the specified file back to the last committed state.

**Example:**
```bash
echo "Temporary changes" >> example.txt
git status
git restore example.txt
```
After running, `example.txt` reverts to its previous state.

**Command for staged changes:**
```bash
git restore --staged <file>
```
**What it does:** Removes the file from the staging area while keeping the changes in the working directory.

**Exercise:**
1. Modify a file and check its status.
2. Stage the changes using `git add`.
3. Run `git restore --staged <file>` to unstage it.
4. Run `git status` to confirm that the file is no longer staged.
5. Then, use `git restore <file>` to discard the changes completely.

These commands give you the flexibility to undo mistakes at various stagesâ€”whether you want to preserve history or simply clear uncommitted changes. Practice each method to understand how they affect your repository.
